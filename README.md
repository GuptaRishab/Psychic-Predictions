# Psychic Predictions

## Abstract

Sales forecasting is an essential component of consumer-oriented markets such as retail, fashion and electronics. In such industries, where demand is volatile, recognizing and adapting to changing consumer needs serves to provide a competitive edge over other players in the market. While many factors may be at work when adjusting business strategies to adhere to consumer demand, one major aspect is historical sales. In this project, we implemented the traditional ARIMA model followed by Facebookâ€™s Prophet model to analyze historical retail sales from a Brazilian E-commerce public dataset, where we were able to predict up to 60 days of sales into the future.
